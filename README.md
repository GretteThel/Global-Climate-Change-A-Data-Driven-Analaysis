# Global-Climate-Change-A-Data-Driven-Analysis
Global Climate Change: A Data-Driven Analaysis by TempTrackers


# Project Overview

This project explores the impact of global climate change through a data-driven approach. Using publicly available datasets, we analyze trends in temperature, greenhouse gas emissions, sea level rise, extreme weather events, and other key climate indicators. Our goal is to provide insights and visualizations that highlight the urgency of climate action.

# Key Features

- Data Collection – Aggregation of climate data from trusted sources (NASA, NOAA, IPCC, Berkeley, Kaggle, etc.).
- Data Analysis & Visualization – Statistical analysis and graphical representations of trends.
- Interactive Dashboards – User-friendly visualizations for better data interpretation.

# Technologies Used

- Programming: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Data Sources: NASA, NOAA, IPCC, Berkeley, WHOI, Berkeley, Kaggle
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Power BI (for visualization)
